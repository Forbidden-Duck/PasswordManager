## Frequently asked questions
### How do I start the program?
You will have to go into the app.config (this will be located along side all the forms). You will need SQL Server downloaded and it is recommended to also have SQL Management Studio. In the app.config locate < connectionStrings > and modifed Data Source as the Server Name and Initial Catalog as the Database name.\
**Do not do this unless you know what you are doing, it is recommended you look at a guide that explains how to setup SQL Server in an app.config**

### How do I create an account
Start the program and on the login screen you will see a blue link like label sitting underneath Password. Click that and you will be greeted with the Account Creation form. Enter a username and password and enter that at the login screen once you have clicked Created. Please keep in mind no account management has been created and if you make a mistake you may have to delete all the users (you don't have to delete the passwords as they will connect up to the same ID as long as you create in the correct order)\
**again we don't recommend using this application if you are not familar with C# and using SQL. A version of this maybe created so it requires no programming skill**

### How do I create a password
Once you have successfully logged in you can click "New Password" in the bottom left and it will bring up a new form. You can enter a title for your password like "Google Account" "GMail Account" and so on and enter the password.\
**Note when editing or adding a new password the password will be visible as text. This is so you can actually edit or add a password with ease**
